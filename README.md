# Arithma

Arithma is a simple puzzle game with a minimalistic UI.  The player is supplied with tiles labeled with numbers and mathematical symbols.  The player must place all of the tiles on the board such that one or more correct equations are formed.  Pieces can be used in multiple different ways, following Scrabble rules. Arithma challenges numerical skills as well as spacial reasoning skills and critical thinking.
